## This is WIFORCE

[Wallenberg Initiatives in Forest Research (WIFORCE)](https://www.slu.se/en/about-slu/organisation/faculties/faculty-of-forest-sciences/wallenberg-initiatives-in-forest-research/about-the-research-programme/about-wiforce/) is a basic science research program that aims to deepen our understanding of the processes behind forest growth, survival, and biodiversity. The knowledge can contribute to sustainable forestry, new management practices, and climate-adapted trees.

WIFORCE is a strategic initiative in natural science-based forest research at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

WIFORCE builds on two strong research programs – one focused on future silviculture and one in forest biology and biotechnology – and is now expanding with several new components. A key investment is the research school, where more than 50 PhD students are being trained, 16 of whom in collaboration with industry and other stakeholders. The program also includes the establishment of five new research groups with cutting-edge expertise to address future challenges. In addition, new arenas for collaboration and innovation are being developed – tools for the future management and conservation of forests.
